## Introduction

This R Markdown document demonstrates my abilities to use models for data analysis using a data set collected on crickets.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library('tidyverse') ; library('modeldata')
``` 

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

## What is that sound?
In this report, we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate.

```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(crickets)
``` 

There is 14 exclamations and 17 niveous. The minimum temperature is 17.20, and the maximum temperature is 30.40. The mean rate of chirping is 72.89
