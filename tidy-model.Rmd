## Introduction

This R Markdown document demonstrates my abilities to use models for data analysis using a data set collected on crickets.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library('tidyverse') ; library('modeldata')
``` 

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```
